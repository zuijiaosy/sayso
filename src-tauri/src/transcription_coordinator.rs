    // Under X11 key auto-repeat, holding a push-to-talk key does not emit one
    // long press. It emits the initial press followed by a stream of
    // synthesized release/press pairs, then a single genuine release on key-up.
    // Before the fix, every synthesized release passed straight through and
    // stopped recording, so holding the key "rapidly toggled" recording on and
    // off. The fix defers each release for a short grace window and cancels it
    // when the matching auto-repeat press arrives.
    //
    // The unit tests above assert the classifiers in isolation. The harness
    // below drives the real `CoordinatorState` through whole event sequences
    // — the same `on_input` / `on_grace_expired` handlers the coordinator
    // thread runs — so a burst can be exercised deterministically without a
    // Tauri AppHandle or real timers, and the tests can never drift from the
